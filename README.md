![Voice Note App](assets/img/vna-1.gif)
<br>

The purpose of this app is to experiment with the Web Speech API which enables you to incorporate voice data into web apps. The Web Speech API has two parts: SpeechSynthesis (Text-to-Speech), and SpeechRecognition (Asynchronous Speech Recognition.)

This app uses the Web Speech API to build a voice powered note app to do 3 things:

 - Takes notes by using voice-to-text or keyboard input.
 - Save voice notes to localStorage.
 - Display all of the saved notes and give the option to either Listen to the Notes or delete them.
